# CocoaConfSlides

These are the slides from our presentation at CocoaConf Seattle 2016.

The presentation was coded using C4 and shown from an iPad.

Unfortunately, we found a new bug during our presentation! https://github.com/C4Framework/C4iOS/issues/666

##A Few Details
We presented 2 projects, an open-source API we've been working on as well as a new design tool that we created.

### C4 
C4 is an opensource creative-coding API for iOS. It can be used for building beautiful user experiences on iOS.

We also use it to create artworks:

### C4 Studio
C4 Studio is a new tool we built that gives designers the ability to use C4 without coding. It harnesses the power of Sketch, and makes it extremely easy to animate static designs the export code:
